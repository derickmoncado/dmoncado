# Hi, I'm Derick 👋

I'm a front-end developer from California who is passionate about building clean, usable, and accessible websites and web applications. I come from a background in Design but have migrated to the world of code over the past 6 years. Some technologies I am currently focusing on include Angular, TypeScript, and a little bit of React. I am no Mark Zuckerberg, but with a strong cup of coffee and an awesome playlist, I can build some pretty cool stuff </>
