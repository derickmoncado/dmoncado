# Hi, I'm Derick 👋

I'm a front-end developer from Northern California who is passionate about building clean, usable, and accessible websites and web applications. I come from a background in Design but have slowly migrated to the world of code over the past 6 years. Some technologies I am currently learning include React, Angular, and TypeScript. I'm **very** new to programming, but think I'm starting to get the hang of this stuff </>
